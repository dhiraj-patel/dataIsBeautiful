Project: Effectiveness of Drone Strikes

Creating graphs to show how many executed drone strikes are effectively killing terrorists, and how many are unfortunately being counterproductive by killing innocent civilians. Hopefully, a clear and accurate represenation of drone strike data will help solve the issue of whether or not they are an effective weapon for the the United States forces.
