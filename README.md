Project: Effectiveness of Drone Strikes

Source: https://www.newamerica.org/in-depth/americas-counterterrorism-wars/

Our project creates graphs to show how many executed drone strikes are effectively killing terrorists, and how many are unfortunately being counterproductive by killing innocent civilians. A clear and accurate representation of drone strike data will help to solve the issue of whether or not drone strikes are an effective weapon for the the United States forces. We use Javascript, CSS, and JS to present the data from our csv files visually. 

Our visual inspiration is the Complete History of the NFL by FiveThirtyEight (https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/complete-history-of-the-nfl/). We will have a color-coded bar graph, giving users the ability to see the data from a president, year, and target status.
